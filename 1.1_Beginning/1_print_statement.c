/* Explanation for this program
 * # include <stdio.h>
This tells the compiler to include a standard library called stdio.h.
stdio means Standard Input/Output.
It contains useful functions like printf, scanf, etc.

* int main ()
This is the main function. Every C program starts executing from here.
int means this function will return an integer value (usually 0 at the end).
{ marks the start of the block of code inside the main function.

* printf("Hello World");
This line prints text on the screen.
printf() is a function from stdio.h.
"Hello World" is the message that gets printed.

* return 0;
Ends the main() function.
Returns 0 to the operating system, which means the program ran successfully.
